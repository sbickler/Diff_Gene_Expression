Of course, this may not always result in the most optimal solultion but is significantly less computationally taxing compared to a brute force approach. As the size of the dataset increases, the greedy approximation is more accurate relative to smaller datasets.\n",

This occurs when there is only a single linkage, or association, between a particular gene and pathway. While the exact probability of this occuring is difficult to compute, it is clear that this approximation improvement becomes less effective for larger datasets as the probability that at least one occurance of this event decreases.
